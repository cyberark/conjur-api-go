## Development
To start developing and testing using our development scripts ,
the following tools need to be installed:

  - Docker
  - docker-compose

### Running tests

To run the test suite, run:
```shell
./bin/test.sh
```

This will spin up a containerized Conjur environment and build the test containers,
and will run all tests.

To run the tests against a specific version of Golang, you can run the following:
```shell
./bin/test.sh 1.21
```

This will spin up a containerized Conjur environment and build the test containers,
and will run the tests in a `golang:1.23` container

Supported arguments are `1.23` and `1.24`, with the
default being `1.23` if no argument is given.

### Setting up a development environment
To start a container with terminal access, and the necessary
test running dependencies installed, run:

```shell
./bin/dev.sh
```

You can then run the following command from the container terminal to run
all tests:

```shell
go test -coverprofile="output/c.out" -v ./... | tee output/junit.output;
exit_code=$?;
echo "Exit code: $exit_code"
```

## Releases

Releases should be created by maintainers only. To create a tag and release,
follow the instructions in this section.

### Pre-requisites

1. Review the git log and ensure the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) contains all
   relevant recent changes with references to GitHub issues or PRs, if possible.
   Also ensure the latest unreleased version is accurate - our pipeline generates 
   a VERSION file based on the changelog, which is then used to assign the version
   of the release and any release artifacts.
1. Review the changes since the last tag, and if the dependencies have changed
   revise the [NOTICES](NOTICES.txt) to correctly capture the included
   dependencies and their licenses / copyrights.
1. Ensure that all documentation that needs to be written has been 
   written by TW, approved by PO/Engineer, and pushed to the forward-facing documentation.
1. Scan the project for vulnerabilities

### Release and Promote

1. Merging into main/master branches will automatically trigger a release. If successful, this release can be promoted at a later time.
1. Jenkins build parameters can be utilized to promote a successful release or manually trigger aditional releases as needed.
1. Reference the [internal automated release doc](https://github.com/conjurinc/docs/blob/master/reference/infrastructure/automated_releases.md#release-and-promotion-process) for releasing and promoting.
